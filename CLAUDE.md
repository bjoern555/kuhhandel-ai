# Project Overview
We are building a Python-based Gym environment for the board game "Kuhhandel" (You're Bluffing). 
The goal is to create a perfectly objective, bug-free game engine that will eventually be used to train Reinforcement Learning (RL) models and mathematical algorithms.

# Code Style & Architecture
- Language: Python 3.
- Style: Strictly Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Libraries: Use `numpy` for arrays and math where appropriate. 
- Typing: Use Python type hinting (`-> int`, `: list`, etc.) for all functions.
- Documentation: Write clear docstrings for all classes and complex functions.
- Testing: We will use test-driven development. Verify logic before moving on.
